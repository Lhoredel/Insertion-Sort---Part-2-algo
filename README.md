# Insertion-Sort---Part-2-algo
This code illustrates the Insertion Sort algorithm by sorting an array and displaying every intermediate step. It goes through each element from the second position, moving larger elements to the right to create room for the current element. Once each element is placed at its proper sorted location, the algorithm displays the array's current state to see how it is progressing.
